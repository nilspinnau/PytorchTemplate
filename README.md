# Pytorch Machine Learning Template #

This is a template which takes away the annoying work of setting up the machine learning enviroment.
Still requires to build the dataset and the models itself and the specifics around training.
Work with config files to allow for easy manipulation of the models, datasets, optimizer etc.

## Getting Started ##

- rename folder torch_template to the project's name, change also in setup.py
